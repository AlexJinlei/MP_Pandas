Pandas' group-by/apply with multiprocessing
===========================================

Pandas is a Python library used for data manipulation.  The main Pandas data structure is the data frame which is very similar to the R data frame. One of the main processing paradigms on data frames is the group-by/apply which is essentially map/reduce. The syntax for group-by/apply is:

result = data_frame.groupby(column_list).apply(apply_func, *args, **kwargs)

When the computation to be performed by the apply function is CPU intensive and/or the number of data frame groups is large, a group-by/apply computation can easily become a processing bottleneck. 
The Pandas library is very fast and in general one is better off leveraging its capabilities. The first and best bottleneck removal step is to make sure that your apply function is optimized. Similarly, often structuring the data differently may lead to a reduction in the number of groups generated by the group-by step. If after having implemented these two steps your group-by/apply is still a processing bottleneck, one may want to consider using multiprocessing.
